# AWaReAntibiotics
This project aims to build a simple Android application for use by treating physicians who wish to prescribe antibiotics. The WHO has released the AWaRe classification of antibiotics grouping them into three classes based on their status with respect to antibiotic resistance - Access, Watch and Reserve. Detailed guidelines for the use of the application will be released soon.

Please note that this is a work in progress.

All work done so far has been with the immense support given by Dr SureshKumar E K, HoD of Pediatrics at Aster MIMS Hospital, Kozhikode who gave the idea for the application and is working with me by providing the correct dosages for each drug.
